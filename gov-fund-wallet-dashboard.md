description: 'The Optimism Governance Fund wallet currently sits in a gnosis safe account. A dashboard would be a useful tool to the governance team to be able to track all of the different subsafes in their account with relevant information (name, OP amount, unlock date, etc). This would also be a useful tool to the community for more visibility into what is in the OP governance wallet. '

# Gov Fund Wallet Dashboard

## Summary

The GovFund wallet is hard to navigate to find out what is in it and where. This dashboard can make it more transparent for the public and gov team alike

## Possible Features

## Why this is cool

It makes gov teams life easier and all of our holdings more transparent to the community. They can verify where their locked grants are held and maybe even when they unlock
