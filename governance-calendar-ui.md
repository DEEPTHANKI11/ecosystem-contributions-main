title: "Governance Calendar UI"
description: "This site should include the following basic information:
- Current season
- Current voting cycle
- All voting cycle start and end dates, including review period, voting period, and Citizens' House veto period
- Retro Funding round dates (as known) 

The key challenge is presenting the above in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand format. What's the best way to get an at-a-glance understanding of where we're at in Optimism governance? 

The site should also automatically update for all known dates, like upcoming voting cycle timing and durations. See the public Optimism governance calendar for source of truth, and consider reading directly from this calendar if possible. 

As an optional feature, the site could also communicate all upcoming scheduled votes taking place in upcoming cycles. This would require an easy WYSIWYG or input format for teams across the Collective to indicate their proposal to be included on the site. This could also read from GitHub or a Google sheet as backend if easier."

# Governance Calendar UI

## Summary

Build a beautiful UI to create better visibility into Optimism governance cycles and retro rounds

## Possible Features

Additional possible features:

- Links to (and or description for) participation in Token House funding mechanisms like Mission Requests and/or Grants Council funding.
- Links to Optimism governance documentation for explanation of key features.

## Why this is cool

Optimism governance is rapidly evolving, and we have many experiments running parallel. This allows for rapid iteration, but it also makes it challenging for community members to stay up-to-date on upcoming dates and milestones. This site could help solve a key accessibility problem for OP gov!
