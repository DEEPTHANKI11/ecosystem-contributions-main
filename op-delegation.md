# OP Delegation Frame

## Summary

Delegate your OP Tokens directly in Farcaster via a frame

## Possible Features

- Followers can click "delegate" or "undelegate"
- Followers can click "subscribe" to receive updates on how the delegate is voting (perhaps via bot)
- The delegate's voting history is shown in the frame (percentage of proposals voted on, percentage voted yes/no)

## Why this is cool

This idea will increase governance accessibility by lowering the barrier to delegation, increasing votable supply. Increasing votable supply makes the governance system more capture-resistant, which is one of our key objectives.

It will also enable influential and trusted community members to use their platforms to become delegates, which will lead to better mobility for new delegates. Reducing the ossification of power and making it easier for newcomers to become delegates is also an important way to improve capture-resistance
