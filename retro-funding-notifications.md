# Retro Funding notifications - Farcaster

## Summary

Build Farcaster tooling so that builders can receive notifications about upcoming Retro Funding rounds which are relevant to them

## Possible Features

1. Implement a Farcaster frame to receive notifications about a Retro Funding round. Below is a possible user flow
   - Pick a Retro Funding round that you're interested in
   - Confirm that you like to receive notifications about the Retro Funding round
2. Implement a bot which posts updated/notifications about rounds and tags the Farcaster users who signed up. (e.g. ""7 more days to sign up for Retro Funding: Onchain Builders, sign-up now!! @FarcasterUser1 @FarcasterUser2..."") 3. (nice to have) Post highlights of Farcaster users who have signed up for the round

## Why this is cool

This idea is cool because it supports builders to stay in touch with relevant milestones of a Retro Funding round
