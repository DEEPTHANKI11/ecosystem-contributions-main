title: "Interactive Governance Onboarding Flow"
description: "Build interactive web app that onboards new optimists to Optimism Governance. 

The web app could ask users a couple of questions to understand their goals in participating in Optimism Governance. 

Consider that users might enter the flow who are looking to build for the Collective, receive a grant or participate in Governance. To gain relevant context/resources you can visit the Optimism Governance docs (https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/)

Try to get users where they need to go in as few steps as possible




The user flow could looks as follows 
1. I see an overview of Optimism's bi-cameral governance system 
2. I select which part of Governance I'm interested in (options can be receiving a grant contributing to the Collective becoming a delegate, delegating my OP)
3. I get shown relevant options dependent on the answer I gave in 1. (e.g. if contributing to the Collective was selected, next question could be Do you already know what you would like to build for the Collective? (Y/N), dependent on the answer the user is forwarded to either Token House missions or builder ideas)"
